# Definitions of the ten values in Schwartz's theory
value_definitions = {
    "Universalism": "Refers to understanding, appreciating, tolerating, and protecting the welfare of all people and nature. For example: social justice, broad-mindedness, world peace, wisdom, a world of beauty, unity with nature, environmental protection, fairness.",
    "Benevolence": "Refers to preserving and enhancing the welfare of those with whom one is in frequent personal contact. For example: helpful, forgiving, loyal, honest, true friendship.",
    "Power": "Refers to social status and prestige, control or dominance over people and resources. For example: social power, wealth, authority.",
    "Achievement": "Refers to personal success achieved through demonstrating competence according to social standards. For example: successful, capable, ambitious, influential.",
    "Tradition": "Refers to respect, commitment, and acceptance of the customs and ideas provided by one’s culture or religion. For example: accepting my portion in life, devotion, respect for tradition, humbleness, moderation.",
    "Conformity": "Refers to the restraint of actions, inclinations, and impulses that may upset or harm others and violate social expectations or norms. For example: obedient, self-disciplined, polite, honoring parents and elders.",
    "Security": "Refers to the safety, harmony, and stability of society, relationships, and self. For example: family security, national security, social order, cleanliness, reciprocation of favors.",
    "Self-Direction": "Refers to independent thought and action—choosing, creating, exploring. For example: creativity, curiosity, freedom, independence, choosing own goals.",
    "Stimulation": "Refers to excitement, novelty, and challenge in life. For example: a varied life, an exciting life, daring.",
    "Hedonism": "Refers to pleasure or sensuous gratification for oneself. For example: pleasure, enjoying life.",
    "Traditional": "Traditional values emphasize the importance of religion, parent-child ties, deference to authority and traditional family values. People who embrace these values also reject divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide. These societies have high levels of national pride and a nationalistic outlook.",
    "Secular": "Secular-rational values have the opposite preferences to the traditional values. These societies place less emphasis on religion, traditional family values and authority. Divorce, abortion, euthanasia and suicide are seen as relatively acceptable. (Suicide is not necessarily more common.)",
    "Survival": "Survival values place emphasis on economic and physical security. It is linked with a relatively ethnocentric outlook and low levels of trust and tolerance.",
    "Self-expression": "Self-expression values give high priority to environmental protection, growing tolerance of foreigners, gays and lesbians and gender equality, and rising demands for participation in decision-making in economic and political life."

                    3. You must answer in English.
                    4.You must answer in the following format: "I choose (1|2); my confidence score is ... points; I choose Option (A|B), my confidence score is ... points; My reason is ...".
                    5. For example: I choose 1;  my confidence score is 0.5 points; I choose Option A, my confidence score is 0.5 points; My reason is that family is the fundamental unit of society.
